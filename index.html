                        <h3>A Brief History of Lions Clubs International</h3>
                        <p class="text-justify">In 1917, Melvin Jones, a 38-year-old Chicago business leader, told members of his local business club they should reach beyond business issues and address the betterment of their communities and the world. Jones' group, the Business
                            Circle of Chicago, agreed. After contacting similar groups around the United States, an organizational meeting was held on June 7, 1917, in Chicago, Illinois, USA. The new group took the name of one of the invited groups, the
                            "Association of Lions Clubs," and a national convention was held in Dallas, Texas, USA in October of that year. A constitution, by-laws, objectives and a code of ethics were approved. And the rest is history. As we approach
                            our 100th anniversary in 2017, it's moment to look back on our long and proud tradition of service and the numerous achievements of our association and Lions around the world.</p>
